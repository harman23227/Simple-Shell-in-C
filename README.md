# 🔧 Custom C Shell

This is a custom shell built in C that replicates many core features of a UNIX shell, including support for:

- ✅ Command parsing with pipes (`|`)
- 🧠 Command history with timing, process ID, and execution duration
- 📦 Background execution (`&`)
- 🚫 Signal handling for graceful exits (`Ctrl+C`)
- 🔁 Input/output redirection (planned or extendable)
- 🧵 Multithreaded-safe command parsing (manages memory allocations carefully)

## ✨ Features

| Feature             | Description                                                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Piped commands       | Supports multiple commands linked with `|`                              |
| Command history      | Tracks each command's start/end time, PID, and execution duration       |
| Background jobs      | Use `&` to run processes in the background                             |
| Signal handling      | Gracefully exits and prints history on `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C)                |
| Modular parsing      | Uses dynamic memory and safe string handling for flexible command input |

## 🛠️ How It Works

- User input is parsed using custom functions `parse()` and `makecmd()` for command separation and argument extraction.
- Commands are executed using `fork()` and `execvp()`.
- Background tasks redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to `/dev/null`.
- `SIGINT` is handled using `sigaction` to print command history before exit.

## 🧪 Example

```bash
$ ls -l | grep ".c" &

Started background process with PID: 12345

$ history

-------------------------------
Command: ls -l | grep ".c"
PID: 12345
Start Time: 1712848000
End Time: 1712848001
Duration: 1.00 seconds
